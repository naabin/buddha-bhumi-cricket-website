        "description": "After winning Naipala, on a friendly match last week, Mt. 8848 was looking confident to get another win, this time against Buddha Bhumi, who were playing their first ever match, although a friendly. First innings started good with, a six off the 2nd ball but were pushed back with some early loss of wickets for BBCC, but were able to come back with a strong middle order partnership of over 50 runs between NKT and Bijay putting up 135 runs by 20 overs. Mt8848 run chase failed when they kept losing wickets and only managed to get 96 runs by 20 overs. All in all, a very good start for the team",

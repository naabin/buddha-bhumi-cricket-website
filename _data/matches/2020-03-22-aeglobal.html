Another exciting day of friendly cricket at Marco Reserve today.
Batting first Buddha Bhumi scored a respectable total of 141 losing 8 of its batters. 
AE Global in its run chase was looking very dangerous, getting 72 for 2 by 10 overs 
but the game soon turned its table when Buddha Bhumi bowlers started getting back to back wickets 
and controlled the flow of runs and managed to pull a thriller till the last over of the match winning it by 4 runs.

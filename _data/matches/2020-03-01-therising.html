Another week another friendly but the result was not so friendly for Buddha Bhumi.
A match against a very strong team combined with some top notch players,
it was a tough battle for Buddha Bhumi specially with its key in-form batsmen missing.
The batting order sort of collapsed in front a formidable bowling attack
and only managed to give a target of 85 runs which the opposition team looked confident to get quite easily
but a magical spell by Nabin KC in the middle overs gave some light of hope to Buddha Bhumi
but unfortunately there was just not enough runs to defend and the opposition won the match by 4 wickets

Exciting day of cricket today. A mammoth chase turned unsuccessful in the end but the fight was absolutely 
inspiring from our batsmen, taking the match to the very last over before losing the match by 17 runs. 
Main takeaway from the match, our batting looks absolutely strong, while there is plenty of room for 
improvement on the bowling side especially with the opening spell. All in all, a great match and special 
thanks to the Rain Gods who thankfully did not pour today ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž

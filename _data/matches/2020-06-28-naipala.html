Collapse of the batting order.
Naipala started off with a storm, batting the first innings, and scoring almost 50 runs without loosing any wickets within the powerplays. 
A breakthrough was all that was needed for GBB to comeback and was immediately provided by our in-form spinner Nabin in the very next over. 
Although GBB managed to get the next 9 wicket regularly and only allowing them to score another 70 odd runs, 
Naipala bowlers did it lot better when they took all 10 wickets of GBB within 70 odd runs. 
GBB just could not build a partnership to see them through the run chase and the entire batting order crumbled as only 2 players scored runs in double digits. 
Many things to learn from this defeat for our boys and come back stronger next time.

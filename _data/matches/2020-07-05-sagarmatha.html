After facing a thrashing defeat last week, the team was looking to get back strong. 
Batting first GBB posted a mammoth target of 153, thanks to a great partnership innings between BJ and Nishant, 
after loosing 2 early wickets within the 2nd over, and some other small partnerships down the order. 
Chasing a big target, Sagarmatha kept loosing wickets in regular interval 
specially in front of the pace attack of our strike bowlers Raju and Rupesh who together took 7 out of the 10 wickets
which helped us to once again wrap up another opposition within 100 runs.

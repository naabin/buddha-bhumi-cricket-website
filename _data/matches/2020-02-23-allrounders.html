Yet another day of good friendly cricket match. Thanks to All Rounders XI Cricket Club for taking the time
to play with us today. A great opening innings by Nishant, followed by a decent middle order batting, which then
backed up by a pretty tight bowling performance, let us hit the pub quite early for a round of 🍻🍺🍻 on a winning note.
Shout out to all our boys for a great performance. Lets keep the momentum strong. 🎉🎉🎉🎉"
